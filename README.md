## Expanding The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to Examine Faculty Use of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) In Higher Education Institutions
Universities have made a considerable investment in the use of Learning Management 
Systems (LMSs) to facilitate their teaching learning processes; however these systems 
are not used by the faculty members to their fullest capabilities. To address this issue, 
this study investigated factors that affect faculty members’ LMSs usage behavior, 
focusing on user related variables and their pivotal role in determining faculty attitudes 
toward LMSs. This study offers an empirical evaluation of an extension of Davis’s
(1989)’s Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to investigate how faculty members’ 
beliefs and attitudes influence their intention and actual use of LMSs under conditions of 
non-mandatory use of LMSs in higher education institutions. Data were obtained from 
560 faculty members (from two universities) and analyzed using Structural Equation 
Modeling. The study results revealed that the three proposed external variables: system 
quality; perceived self-efficacy and facilitations conditions were significant predictors of 
faculty attitude towards LMSs. Similar to prior research findings, the study results further 
confirmed the validity of the extended TAM in determining users’ technology acceptance 
behavior. The study also addressed the implications of the findings for researchers and 
practitioners.
